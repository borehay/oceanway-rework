  <p>These courses can be tailored to suit the different requirements of recreational divers, scientists, government personnel, teachers, secondary and tertiary level students and consultancy companies.</p>
  <p>Theoretical knowledge is presented as lectures and interactive discussion. Underwater / practical sessions provide an opportunity to apply theory and give students a practical application of their course subject.</p>
  <p>We are flexible with course content; sensitive to individual needs and learning ability.</p>
  <p>At OCL we provide IANTD and PADI training based around the “Doing It Right” philosophy: providing a sound foundation with a combined Open water/ Advanced / Nitrox class all the way to Trimix diving. In addition, for specialized applications we can provide rebreather training. Other training courses include diving equipment and general compressor maintenance.</p>
  <p>All of our courses can be conducted in both English and Cantonese.</p>
